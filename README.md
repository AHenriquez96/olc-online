Welcome to the working repository for the Open Leadership Camp online! We're going to be using Github to quickly and easily transform all the thinking and planning you've been doing during Camp into a living, breathing open project. 

If you've never used GitHub before, don't worry. We're here to help if things get confusing. 

First things first -- here's your to-do list:

## To-do:
- [ ] [Make yourself a Github account](https://github.com/join) (if you don't already have one) 

- [ ] Fork this repository
    - The button is located in the top right corner of the page. It says "Fork".
    - When you click this button, a copy of this repository will be put ("forked") into your account.
    - Then, you'll be free to remix this template by deleting these instructions and adding your own project information.
